We consider that all Principles are reflected in the Act but in some cases this is not explicit. Please see below commentary for Principles where consideration is implicit.   Re: Principle 2, there are several provisions that implicitly refer to reliable methods and procedures for official statistics: a purpose of the Act is to ensure production of high-quality official statistics (section 3(a)); a function of the Government Statistician is to guide and direct best practice in producing and communicating official statistics (section 13(f)); and the Government Statistician can set mandatory standards for collecting data, producing statistics and undertaking research (section 90).   Re: Principle 9, although section 13 ‘Functions of Statistician’ does not require the alignment of methods and classifications with international standards, it does include the function ‘to collaborate with statistics offices or agencies outside New Zealand to produce globally comparable statistics’. Stats NZ considers that this work would not be possible without the alignment of methods and classifications with international standards.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
