It shall be noted that the Statistics Ordinance came into existence long before the digital revolution that made international comparisons a central part of the work in NSOs. In light of the changing technology and international demands,  the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics interprets Section 3(c) of the Ordinance (“The Statistician shall, in carrying out his functions, act on the basis of scientific principles”) to include the use of international standards (Principle 9). Thus we believe that the Ordinance is in compliance with principle 9. Regarding Principle 10 (International cooperation), while the Ordinance makes no explicit reference to it, such cooperation is implied according to the interpretation of Section 3(c) of the Ordinance. In practice, the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics complies with international standards and fully cooperates with the international organizations in carrying out their functions and duties. In doing so, the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics sees the use of “international standards” and “international cooperation” as among  its duties and functions according to its mandate under the Ordinance. To sum up, the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics interprets the Statistics Ordinance to mandate the use of international standards (Section 3(c)) and to mandate international cooperation (Section 3(c) and Section 18(b)(3)). This interpretation is acted upon in practice. Thus, we feel it is inaccurate to describe the Statistics Ordinance as not being in compliance with the Principles."
